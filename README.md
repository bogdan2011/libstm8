libstm8
=======

C library for STM8 microcontroller. For now I have only stm8l152 for testing.

I want to create library with API similar to [libopencm3](http://www.libopencm3.org/)
library for STM32 microcontrollers.

You can compile own projects for STM8 controllers with [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/)
and flash it with [stm8flash](https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash) utility.
